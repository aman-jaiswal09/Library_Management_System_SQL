#  Library Management System (LMS)

##  Project Overview
This project implements a Library Management System (LMS) to manage books, members, and rental transactions. The SQL queries handle book records, member details, and rental operations efficiently.

##  Tools & Technologies Used
- SQL (Structured Query Language)
- Database Management System (DBMS) (e.g., MySQL, PostgreSQL)
- CRUD Operations (`INSERT`, `UPDATE`, `SELECT`, `DELETE`)
- Joins & Relationships (Connecting books, members, and rentals)
- Aggregation Functions (`COUNT`, `SUM`, `AVG` for analytics)

##  Key Insights & Results
1. Book Management: Added new book records using `INSERT` queries.
2. Member Information: Updated member details efficiently.
3. Book Rentals: Tracked rentals with `JOIN` queries.
4. Availability Status: Checked book availability in real-time.
5. Late Fee Calculation: Implemented fine calculations using SQL logic.
6. Top Borrowed Books: Identified popular books using `COUNT` queries.
7. Member Borrowing Trends: Analyzed frequent borrowers.
8. Database Integrity: Ensured data consistency with primary & foreign keys.
9. Efficient Queries: Optimized retrieval times for large datasets.
10. Scalability: Designed for potential future enhancements.


##  How to run
1. Import the SQL file into your database management system.
2. Run the queries to create and manage the library database.
3. Modify or extend queries to add additional functionalities.

##  Future Enhancements
- Implement a web-based frontend for better user interaction.
- Add automation for overdue book reminders.
- Develop data visualization dashboards for deeper insights.
